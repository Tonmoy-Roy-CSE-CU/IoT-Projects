Determining the "standard" soil moisture level for crops depends on the specific crop type, growth stage, climate, and irrigation requirements. The soil moisture levels you provided (ranging from 950-1024 for no moisture to 600 for wet, with intermediate thresholds) are based on your sensor's analog readings (0-1023 for a 10-bit ADC). These values are relative to your sensor's calibration and may not directly correlate to standard agricultural metrics like volumetric water content (VWC, typically 0-100%) or field capacity without calibration against a known standard. However, we can interpret your levels in a practical context for crop health and suggest an optimal range.

### Analysis of Your Levels
- **Range**: 600 (wet) to 1024 (dry), with 7 intermediate levels (875, 840, 810, 750, 691, 680, 640).
- **Sensor Behavior**: Higher values (e.g., 950-1024) indicate dry soil (less conductivity), while lower values (e.g., 600) indicate wet soil (more conductivity), which is typical for resistive soil moisture sensors.
- **Crop Needs**: Most crops thrive when soil moisture is maintained between "moist" and "slightly moist" levels, avoiding extremes of dryness or saturation to prevent stress or root rot.

### Standard Soil Moisture for Crops
- **General Guidelines** (based on VWC or sensor readings):
  - **Dry (e.g., >875)**: Unsuitable for most crops; irrigation needed to prevent wilting.
  - **Medium to Moist (e.g., 680-810)**: Ideal for most crops (e.g., vegetables like tomatoes, rice, wheat), supporting healthy root growth and nutrient uptake.
  - **Wet/Saturated (e.g., <640)**: Risk of waterlogging; suitable only for water-tolerant crops (e.g., rice) or post-irrigation drainage.
- **Field Capacity**: Typically 50-70% VWC, which might map to your 680-750 range depending on calibration.
- **Wilting Point**: ~20-30% VWC, possibly around 875-950 in your scale.

Without exact VWC calibration, we can infer from your data:
- **Optimal Range**: Likely **Level 4 (750-809)** to **Level 6 (680-690)**, corresponding to "Medium dry soil" to "Moist soil," as this balances water availability and aeration for most crops.

### Crop-Specific Considerations
- **Tomatoes/Peppers**: Prefer 60-80% VWC (roughly 680-750 in your scale).
- **Rice**: Tolerates 80-100% VWC (600-680).
- **Wheat**: Needs 50-70% VWC (750-810).
- **Root Crops (e.g., Carrots)**: Avoid saturation (<640); aim for 680-810.

### Recommendation Based on Your Code
Your 7-level system provides detailed monitoring, which is excellent for an agri-bot. The "standard" for crops would be maintaining soil moisture within the following levels:
- **Target Range**: **Level 4 (750-809)** to **Level 6 (680-690)**.
  - **Reason**: This range (Medium dry to Moist) aligns with the field capacity and water needs of common crops, avoiding drought stress (>875) or waterlogging (<640).
  - **Action**: Irrigate if sensor_data ≥ 810 (Level 3 or higher) and stop if sensor_data ≤ 680 (Level 6 or lower).

### Adjusted Code with Standard Indication
To highlight the optimal range, I’ll add a note in the serial output when the moisture is within the standard range (680-809):

```cpp
// YouTube | Tech at Home

int sensor_pin = A0;

void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(sensor_pin, INPUT);
}

void loop()
{
  int sensor_data = analogRead(sensor_pin);
  Serial.print("Sensor_data: ");
  Serial.print(sensor_data);
  Serial.print("\t | ");

  if (sensor_data >= 950 && sensor_data <= 1024) // No moisture
  {
    Serial.println("No moisture, Soil is dry (Level 0) - Irrigate!");
  }
  else if (sensor_data >= 875 && sensor_data < 950) // Level 1
  {
    Serial.println("Level 1: Very dry soil - Irrigate!");
  }
  else if (sensor_data >= 840 && sensor_data < 875) // Level 2
  {
    Serial.println("Level 2: Dry soil - Irrigate!");
  }
  else if (sensor_data >= 810 && sensor_data < 840) // Level 3
  {
    Serial.println("Level 3: Slightly dry soil - Consider irrigation");
  }
  else if (sensor_data >= 750 && sensor_data < 810) // Level 4
  {
    Serial.println("Level 4: Medium dry soil - Within standard range");
  }
  else if (sensor_data >= 691 && sensor_data < 750) // Level 5
  {
    Serial.println("Level 5: Slightly moist soil - Within standard range");
  }
  else if (sensor_data >= 680 && sensor_data < 691) // Level 6
  {
    Serial.println("Level 6: Moist soil - Within standard range");
  }
  else if (sensor_data >= 640 && sensor_data < 680) // Level 7
  {
    Serial.println("Level 7: Very moist soil - Monitor for waterlogging");
  }
  else if (sensor_data < 640 && sensor_data >= 600) // Below Level 7 to min
  {
    Serial.println("Soil is wet (below Level 7) - Risk of waterlogging");
  }
  else if (sensor_data < 600) // Wettest
  {
    Serial.println("Soil is fully saturated - Drain if possible");
  }

  delay(100);
}
```

### Changes Made
- **Standard Range Highlight**: Marked 750-809 (Level 4) to 680-690 (Level 6) as "Within standard range," indicating optimal crop conditions.
- **Action Suggestions**: Added irrigation or drainage advice for extremes (e.g., ">875" or "<640") to guide your agri-bot’s automation.

### Practical Application
- **Irrigation Trigger**: Program your bot to irrigate when sensor_data ≥ 810 (Level 3 or higher).
- **Alert System**: Use Wi-Fi (e.g., with Blynk) to notify when outside 680-809.
- **Crop-Specific Tuning**: Adjust the range (e.g., 600-750 for rice) based on your crop after testing.

### Testing and Calibration
- Test with your soil sensor across dry-to-wet conditions and compare with a moisture meter if available.
- If readings deviate, recalibrate the thresholds (e.g., shift all values by a constant offset).

This setup provides a solid foundation for your agri-bot’s soil monitoring. Let me know if you’d like to integrate this with image processing or add irrigation control! It’s 12:58 PM +06, September 01, 2025—let’s grow some healthy crops!
